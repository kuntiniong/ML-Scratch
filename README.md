# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This ongoing repository is my implementation of machine learning models covered in Stanford's [CS229](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&si=7-F0AHFPv3rBF4VZ) with Python and NumPy. 

## About

In this repo, I have included most of the models covered in CS229, all entirely built from scratch. Each model came with detailed explanations and was tested with a classic dataset from Kaggle. 

Those 8 models include (sorted in category):

* Supervised Learning:
  * Discriminative Algorithms:
    * [Linear Regression - House Price Prediction](01_linear_regression/house_price.ipynb)
    * [Logistic Regression - Brain Tumor Classification](02_logistic_regression/brain_tumor.ipynb)
    * [Decision Trees - Titanic Survival Classification](05_decision_trees/titanic.ipynb) 
    * [Supported Vector Machines (SVM) - Iris Flower Classification](04_svm/iris.ipynb) (still in progress)
  * Generative Algorithms:
    * [Naive Bayes - Email Spam Classification](03_naive_bayes/email_spam.ipynb)
  * Deep Learning:
    * [Neural Network - Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)](06_neural_network/mnist.ipynb) (still in progress)

* Unsupervised Learning:
  * Clustering
    * [K-means- Customer Segmentation](07_k_means/customer.ipynb) (still in progress)
  * Dimensionality Reduction
    * [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Face Recognition](08_pca/eigenfaces.ipynb) (still in progress)
